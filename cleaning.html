      <h2>Exterior Cleaning with Simple Paint Solutions</h2>
      <p>
        Exterior surfaces face constant exposure to the elements — rain, wind, grime, mold, moss, and everything in between. Over time, dirt and organic buildup can stain your home, wear down finishes, and even damage your property. At Simple Paint Solutions, we offer professional pressure washing, soft washing, and gutter cleaning services designed to restore your home’s beauty — safely, efficiently, and affordably. 
      </p>

      <h3>Pressure Washing.</h3>
      <p>
        Our pressure washing service uses professional-grade equipment to remove years of built-up grime from concrete, brick, and other hard exterior surfaces. Whether it’s a mossy sidewalk, an oil-stained driveway, or faded fencing, we cut through the gunk to bring back clean, refreshed surfaces — no shortcuts, no surface damage. 
      </p>

      <h3>Soft Washing.</h3>
      <p>
       For areas like siding, stucco, or painted wood, high pressure can do more harm than good. That’s where our soft washing service comes in. We use low-pressure water combined with eco-friendly cleaning agents to gently remove algae, mildew, and dirt — leaving your home clean and protected, without risking damage to paint or materials. 
      </p>

      <h3>Gutter Cleaning.</h3>
      <p>
        Clogged gutters might seem harmless — until they cause water to overflow into your roofline or foundation. Our gutter cleaning service clears out leaves, moss, and debris, helping your gutters do their job: redirecting water away from your home. It’s simple maintenance that saves you from costly repairs down the line.
